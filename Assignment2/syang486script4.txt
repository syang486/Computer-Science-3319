-- @the delete command did not delete the rows because the doctor who got his/her license before Jan 1, 1965, is the head doctor of a hospital and there is not "ON DELETE CASCADE" command to the foreign key on the creation of table hospital. When deleting the data in table doctor, the database will not help us to delete the data of headdocid attribute in table hospital, and we need to delete them ourselves. Since the headdocid attribute in table hospital is still a foreign key referenced to the licensenumber attribute in table doctor and we forget to delete the data of headdocid attribute in table hospital before deleting data in table doctor, the database will cause foreign key constraint error.
